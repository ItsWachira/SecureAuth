# SecureAuth

SecureAuth is a web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack that provides secure authentication for users. The application provides a secure login and signup system using encryption techniques to protect sensitive information such as passwords and user data.

The application uses a mailing system (SMTP) to send confirmation emails to users upon successful registration, ensuring that only verified users can access the system. SecureAuth also includes features such as password reset and two-factor authentication to provide users with additional layers of security.

The frontend of the application is built using React, providing a clean and intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database for storing user information.

SecureAuth is designed with security in mind, utilizing industry-standard security practices to ensure that user data is protected at all times. The application also provides detailed logs and audit trails to track user activity, helping to prevent unauthorized access and providing a record of all system events.

Overall, SecureAuth is a robust and secure authentication application built using the MERN stack that provides a comprehensive solution for managing user accounts and ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
